## 1 What is python?
Python is a programming language. You write code files, and then you can run the code files, and they'll do what you told them to do.

Just like Word reads `.docx` files, Python reads `.py` files; except instead of containing your essay, `.py` files contain instructions that tell Python what you want it to do.
